Project Overview
This project is a responsive landing page for a real estate company named "Real Trust." The landing page includes various sections such as a hero section, services, projects, client testimonials, a newsletter subscription, and a contact form. The design is modern and user-friendly, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons.

Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the webpage is built using HTML5.
CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components, providing a utility-first approach to design.
JavaScript: Although not extensively used in the provided code, a placeholder for a JavaScript file (main.js) is included for potential interactivity.
Font Awesome: Icons are included from Font Awesome for visual enhancement.
Google Fonts: The Roboto font is used for typography.
Instructions to Run the Project Locally
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone or Download the Project:

You can either clone the repository (if hosted on a platform like GitHub) or download the HTML file directly.
Set Up Your Local Environment:

Ensure you have a web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
You do not need any special server setup for this static HTML page, but if you want to run it on a local server, you can use tools like Live Server (VS Code extension) or any simple HTTP server.
Open the HTML File:

If you are using a web browser, simply double-click the index.html file (or whatever you named it) to open it.
If you are using a local server, navigate to the directory where your HTML file is located and start the server. For example, if you are using Python, you can run:
bash




Check for Dependencies:

The project uses external libraries (Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome). Ensure you have an internet connection to load these resources, as they are linked via CDN in the HTML file.
Modify and Experiment:

You can edit the HTML file in any text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++) to customize the content, styles, or add JavaScript functionality.
Additional Notes
Images: Ensure that any local images referenced in the code are correctly linked. The provided code has a local image path that may not work unless the image is available in the specified location.
JavaScript Functionality: The main.js file is referenced but not provided. You can create this file to add interactivity, such as form validation or dynamic content loading.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS's utility classes.
By following these instructions, you should be able to run the landing page locally and make any desired modifications.
